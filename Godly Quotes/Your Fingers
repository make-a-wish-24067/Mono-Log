Have you ever heard of the saying, "Evil spirits will seep into your hands three times a day? It just means that evil spirits seep into your hands three times a day . . . and if 
you hit or touch someone when that happens . . . they might die even if you didn't put much strength into it. That's why my mom said that you should never touch people carelessly. 
Because they might accidentally die even if you just tap them with your hand.
So I have a question for you:
What are you all using . . . to type on your keyboards?
