Parent teacher conferences. Almost got one. In order to get the prize of a conference with your teacher and parents, you have to:
A) Get your score under 83% by failing.
B) Get some horrible (awesome) behavioral problems.

During class, I chat and sketch with the friend (the one who swears all the time). Another friend (the one that can kill you with one death glare) would be looking at us like we 
are maniacs. (But we are tho, but whatever) Thank god the teacher isn't a total maniac that picks on every student just to embarass you in front of the whole f-ing stupid class.
Another time, I WAS ON FRIKIN 83.13%. YO! RIGHT ON THE BORDER. Genius me doesn't need to have an idiotic conference with my damn parents and teacher.

…

Happy ever after? NO. 
This is what my mom said: “You are slacking in language arts. I am going to request a conference with your teacher.
YO. THATS ALMOST AS STUPID AD WALKING INTO A POLE AND THEN DOING A BACKFLIP TO ACT COOL AND THEN DROPPING YOUR LUNCH AND FALLING ON YOUR BUTT. YO YO YO.
Well… that was a chaotic ending. Let's all hope that the next one is better.

Peace out ~
